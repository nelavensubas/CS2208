# Computer Science 2208 - Introduction to Computer Organization and Architecture - The University of Western Ontario
## Course Description
This course will let you understand the basics and fundamentals of computer organization and architecture, i.e., how a computer works and what a computer does. The course covers the internal representation of various data types, e.g., characters, integers, and floating-points, the addition and subtraction operations and how they are internally performed, and the architectural components of digital computers, how these components are interconnected, and the nature of the information flow between them. ARM assembly language is used to reinforce these issues.
## Assignments
- Assignment 4: An ARM assembly program to determine whether a string of printable ASCII letters stored in memory is a palindrome or not.
- Assignment 5: An ARM assembly language program to copy a null-terminated *STRING1* to a nullterminated *STRING2* after removing any occurrences of the word “the” (case sensitive) in *STRING1*.
